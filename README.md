# NOTICE

With the recent releases and more to come still, the Hasql ecosystem undergoes major changes. It is expected that the users will need a thorough introduction. Hence this notice is to inform you that a thorough documentation with tutorials targeted at both the newcomers and the users who need to migrate from the older versions of the ecosystem are coming soon and are slated to be published until the end of 2015.
